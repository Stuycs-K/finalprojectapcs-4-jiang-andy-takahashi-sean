### 2025-05-24
Got pieces to move and rotate, but collisions don't work

### 2025-05-25
Finished collision checking with the borders, need to get it working for other pieces (there has to be some locking method we add)

### 2025-05-27
Finished locking mechanism in class. Finished clearing rows at home and also added a grid and ghost blocks to make playing easier.

### 2025-05-28
Finished hold pieces in class. Finished ticks at home. Need to add end behavior tomorrow, and ideally fix O-piece rotation and add rotation kicks (not in MVP).

Added basic rotation kicks (still need to work on S, Z, and T-spins) and improved movement when the piece reaches the end of the board.

Added the end of the game, and shifted spawn higher.

### 2025-06-03
Changed the way the rotation system worked in order to make kicks easier.

# Project Description

Period 4
Andy Jiang, Sean Takahashi

Group name(tbd)

We will implement the same rules as the original TETRIS game. The 7 distinct tetriminos would be added to a queue (the “bag”) and cycled through. There will be a feature to set custom controls for hold, spin, and hard drop. We will also have a 2 player option as well. It will keep track of the score using multipliers like tetris, perfect clear, and t-spins along with the current speed of the blocks. There could be a feature to choose between classic (NES), modern, or 2 player.

# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface). (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

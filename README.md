# Project Description

Period 4
Andy Jiang, Sean Takahashi

Group name(tbd)

We will implement the same rules as the original TETRIS game. The 7 distinct tetriminos would be added to a queue (the “bag”) and cycled through. There will be a feature to set custom controls for hold, spin, and hard drop. We will also have a 2 player option as well. It will keep track of the score using multipliers like tetris, perfect clear, and t-spins along with the current speed of the blocks. There could be a feature to choose between classic (NES), modern, or 2 player.

At minimum, we would like to have a working modern TETRIS with the original features of the game included. By the end, it would be nice to have the option to switch between modes such as two player or NES.

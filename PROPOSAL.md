# IDEAS:

## 1: Block Blast
There will be a set of blocks that you place on a 8 x 8 grid. When a full row or column is full, the blocks clear them and score is added. When there is no more space, the game is over. We will keep track of the score, including multipliers like combos and full clears.

## 2: Tetris
We will implement the same rules as the original game. The 7 distinct tetriminos would be added to a queue (the “bag”) and cycled through. There will be a feature to set custom controls for hold, spin, and hard drop. Maybe add a feature where you can play against someone else (2 player option). We wil keep track of score, with multipliers like tetris, perfect clear, and t-spins. There could be a feature to choose between  classic (NES), modern, or 2 player.

## 3: Space Invaders
There will be a controllable ship that moves around the bottom of the screen to shoot waves of aliens. The rounds and spawns will be randomized, and score will be tracked. There would be random power ups like shields, and there would be a few fixed boss levels.
